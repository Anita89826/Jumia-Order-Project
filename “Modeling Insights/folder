## 🧱 Data Model Overview

The data model for the **Jumia Order Data Project** was designed using a **Star Schema** to support efficient aggregation and easy cross-filtering in Power BI.

### Fact Table
- **Fact_Sales** — Contains all transaction-level details such as Cost, Price, Quantity, OrderDate, and associated Customer, Product, and Region IDs.

### Dimension Tables
- **DimCustomer** — Includes customer demographics such as Age, Gender, Occupation, IncomeBracket, and MaritalStatus.
- **DimProduct** — Contains product attributes such as Category, Subcategory, and ProductID.
- **DimTerritory** — Stores Region and Location details for sales geography.
- *(Optional)* **DimDate** — Can be added to support time-based analysis (Year, Month, Quarter).

### Relationships
- One-to-Many relationships connect dimension keys (`CustomerID`, `ProductID`, `Region`) to their corresponding fact fields.
- Filters flow from dimension to fact, enabling clear drill-down analysis.

This model forms the foundation for analyzing sales performance, customer segmentation, and regional insights across Jumia’s marketplace.
