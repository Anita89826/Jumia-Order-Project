Project Overview

This project analyzes 3,000 Jumia customer orders to uncover insights into sales performance, 
customer behavior, and regional purchasing patterns. Using Power BI, 
I cleaned, modeled, and transformed the dataset into an interactive
ashboard supporting strategic e-commerce decision-making.
